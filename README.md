## Project Background

The purpouse of this project is to showcase a way of creating a larger scale Flutter app using a **monorepo** structure and following the **Clean Architecture** principle.

It makes it best to recreate the design and user experience of [SR Play](https://apps.apple.com/se/app/sveriges-radio-play/id300548244), a radio app from Swedish Public Radio, Sveriges Radio.
The app makes use of Sveriges Radio`s [open API](https://sverigesradio.se/oppetapi) to get content about shows, episodes and channels.

This app has no intensions of being published. It only serves as a example of how to structure a Flutter app.
